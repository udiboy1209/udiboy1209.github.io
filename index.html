Hello! This is Meet Udeshi, a second year undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering Dept. at IIT Bombay.
Coding, tinkering with electronics/robotics, watching movies/TV shows and painting are some of my favourite hobbies. 
I also like stargazing and reading books :D .
I've done a lot of interesting coding stuff (cool Android apps, games and much more :P ) - Check out the <a href="/?menu=projects">Projects</a> section.  
I am currently a convener for <a href="https://facebook.com/electronicsiitb">The Electronics Club - IIT Bombay</a>
