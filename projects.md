Open Sources Contributions
---------------------

I have been contributing to open source projects on github for a while. I have also contributed a bit to open source hardware by designing boards and circuits for the Electronics Club, IIT Bombay. I am currently actively contributing to [kivy](https://github.com/kivy). 

I also have a list of my own open source projects which I am maintaining:

 - [**Fast Playlist**](https://github.com/udiboy1209/fast_playlist)<br>
   A webapp to create and play youtube playlists in a lightning fast way. It is aimed toward making listening to songs on youtube as easy as pi. It is hosted [here](https://udiboy1209/github.io/fast_playlist)
 - [**Image Progress Bar**](https://github.com/udiboy1209/ImageProgressBar)<br>
   Android library for using custom images as progress bars. Had initially designed it for use in the IIT Bombay TechFest 2015 Android App, after which I moved it to my own repository.
 - [**EasyFill**](https://github.com/Sumith1896/EasyFill)<br>
   Android application along with a server side app to ease out the process of event registrations in IIT Bombay. The clubs on cmpus hold a lot of events ranging from small to large-scale, where they require that attendees register with the club for further updates. This android app makes it a one click job to register at such an event.
 - [**3dwite**](https://github.com/udiboy1209/3dwrite)<br>
   Put me in an overnight train with no internet and a laptop with a fully charged battery and you get this. Write in a **3D font** in the terminal! Its basically a custom designed 3D font using ascii characters and a python script which uses that to write text. Check the README on the github repo, or this page's source if you want to see an example :D

 - [**XLR8 Remote Control**](https://github.com/elec-club-iitb/xlr8-remote-control)<br>
   This is a blutooth remote control for a differential drive robot. I implemented it with help of other Electronics Club, IITB members for participants of a college competition. Requires an android app, and an avr circuit to interface with the HC-05. Read more details on [this blog](https://elec-club-iitb.github.io/blog/2016/03/remote-controlling-a-bot-with-android).
