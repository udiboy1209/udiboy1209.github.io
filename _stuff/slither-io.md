I found this really fun and extremely addictive game a few days back: [slither.io](http://slither.io)! 
The gameplay is simple enough. 
You are a slithering worm in a world full of slithering worms, and you have to survive and grow by eating food and not hitting head-on into another worm.
I've not been able to stop myself from just going online and slithering around for a while here. Whats even more interesting is that due to this game's increasing
popularity and simplicity, there's a lot of ***bot*** worms popping up. I think they are being controlled by some machine learning algorithm. Would be a cool project to do!
That is if I knew machine learning :P.
